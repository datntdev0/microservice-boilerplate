# How to update database schema

## Adding new migrations

When you need to update the database schema, follow these steps:

1. Update the entity classes in the `Application` project on your microservice.
2. Create a new migration using the Entity Framework Core Package Manager Console or CLI on `Migrator` project:

   ```bash
   Add-Migration <MigrationName> -OutputDir Migrations/<MicroserviceName> -Context <MicroserviceName>DbContext
   ```
3. Apply the migration to the database by running the `Migrator` project. Which includes schema migrations and data seeding.

## Squash migrations into a single migration

If you have multiple migrations and want to squash them into a single migration, follow these steps:

1. Remove all existing migrations from the `Migrations` folder in the `Migrator` project.
   ```bash
   Remove-Migration -Context <MicroserviceName>DbContext
   ```
2. Update the `DbContext` to reflect the current state of your database schema.
3. Create a new migration that captures the current state of the database schema:

   ```bash
   Add-Migration Initial_Database -OutputDir Migrations/<MicroserviceName> -Context <MicroserviceName>DbContext
   ```
